### **Introducing the Workplace Support App (WSA)**

Ensure the safety of your community-based staff and streamline your visit reporting with our free, self-hosted Workplace Support App.

Designed for organizations with staff in the field, this system combines a robust **Lone Worker Safety System** with a flexible **Visit Reporting Tool**, all in one free PWA.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Worker App (PWA for Smartphones):**
    * The worker uses the app to start a safety timer when they arrive on site.
    * When they are finished, they tap "Depart & File Report".
    * A custom or standard checklist appears, allowing them to log visit details and notes.
    * The report is saved to a central Google Sheet, even if the worker is offline (it syncs later).

2.  **Monitoring Dashboard (Web App):**
    * A safety monitor has a live dashboard showing all active workers, their status, location, and battery level.
    * All safety features (Panic Button, Duress PIN, Overdue Alerts) function in real-time.

3.  **Central Database (Google Sheet):**
    * All safety and visit report data is logged to your private Google Sheet.
    * Administrators can define custom checklists for specific companies in a separate tab.
    * Easily filter, sort, or create pivot tables to generate monthly reports for your clients.

**Core Safety & Reporting Features:**

* **Full Safety Suite:** Includes Panic Button (SOS), Duress PIN, automated overdue email alerts, and optional check-ins.
* **Custom & Standard Checklists:** Define a standard report form for all visits, or create unique checklists for specific companies.
* **Offline Reporting:** Workers can fill out and save their visit reports even with no internet connection. The app queues the reports and uploads them automatically when back online.
* **Live Monitoring:** The monitor's dashboard shows all active workers, prioritized by alert status.
* **GPS & Battery Tracking:** The system logs GPS on alerts and provides the monitor with the worker's last known phone battery level.
